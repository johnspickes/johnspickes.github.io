<p>I want to try a different approach to my online interactions.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve played with Facebook for a while, and I&rsquo;ve decided, for now anyway, that
it&rsquo;s not my thing.  Other social media seem to have similar problems.</p>

<h3 id="fighting:88456f7beb06096f14a2665c85bcb409">Fighting</h3>

<p>Conversations on Facebook are too often heated.</p>

<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s that everything is open - all conversations potentially have an
audience.  Maybe that drives people to feel that they must &ldquo;win&rdquo; every
argument.  Often, the conversation participants are &ldquo;friends of friends&rdquo;,
writing to people they don&rsquo;t know, making assumptions about them based on
little or no information.  Taking up adversarial positions against people with
whom, in a different context, they might be friendly and productive.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say that argument and disagreement are unproductive.  When you and
I disagree, that&rsquo;s an important indicator that at least one of us (maybe both!)
hasn&rsquo;t converged on the truth.  I want truth-seeking.  I don&rsquo;t want fighting.</p>

<h3 id="lack-of-focus:88456f7beb06096f14a2665c85bcb409">Lack of Focus</h3>

<p>Social media bombards us with a hundred things at once.  A friend&rsquo;s interesting
essay is stuck between shared comic strips, pictures of yesterday&rsquo;s dinner, and
updates about which beers people have consumed.  There&rsquo;s no focus.  There&rsquo;s no
quiet space in which to ruminate upon the subject at hand.  To log on to Facebook
is to put one&rsquo;s lips to the firehose.</p>

<p>I want focus and order - to make a conscious choice what to spend my time on right
now - not to be constantly distracted by internet squirrels.</p>

<h3 id="towards-humanity:88456f7beb06096f14a2665c85bcb409">Towards Humanity</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to try using this blog to interact in a different way.  A more human way.
A more focused way.  Here&rsquo;s what I have in mind:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll occasionally write stuff here.  If you&rsquo;d like to talk with me about
something I&rsquo;ve written here, please do one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Call me</li>
<li>Talk to me in person</li>
<li>Send me an email to john@spickes.net</li>
</ul>

<p>I really do want to talk with you.  I&rsquo;ll probably even turn our discussion into more
posts here, if that&rsquo;s OK with you.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;d like, you can create your own blog somewhere.  I&rsquo;ll help you, if
you&rsquo;d like help.  Let me know where your blog lives, and I&rsquo;ll pay check it when
I have reading time, instead of browsing Facebook.</p>
