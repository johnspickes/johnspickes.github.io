<h3 id="some-things-are-under-our-control-while-others-are-not:40626cd8c68e6d6c813cf7ed8baa1fc8">Some things are under our control, while others are not.</h3>

<p>This is one of the core teachings of the ancient philosophy of Stoicism: that
we should be always aware of which things are inside our control, and which
things are outside.  What purpose does it serve to maintain an awareness of the
limits of our control?</p>

<p><strong>Knowing the limits of our control tells us where to focus our emotional
energies.</strong></p>

<p>Simply put, if a thing is outside of your control, then your emotional energy
is better invested elsewhere.</p>

<h3 id="the-tide:40626cd8c68e6d6c813cf7ed8baa1fc8">The Tide</h3>

<p>Consider an example: the tide.  The relative motion of the Earth and Moon cause
the sea to rise and fall in a regular cycle.  The tide is extremely powerful
compared to you and I, and it&rsquo;s entirely indifferent to (indeed unaware of) our
needs and desires.  Suppose the tide is troublesome to you for some reason.
Perhaps you want to build a house, but the tide keeps rising and flooding your
preferred building site.</p>

<p>What would be the effects of your becoming upset about the tide?  The tide itself
will certainly not be affected.  A house built in the way of the tide will continue
to be flooded, regardless of your feelings about it.  The primary effect of your
upset will be to injure your well-being.</p>

<p>I have intentionally chosen an example where it is plain to see that it&rsquo;s
futile to get upset.  Now, let&rsquo;s move on to less obvious examples.</p>

<h3 id="my-personal-malinvestment:40626cd8c68e6d6c813cf7ed8baa1fc8">My Personal Malinvestment</h3>

<p>Here&rsquo;s one from my own history.  I used to become very emotionally invested in
political matters.  I saw wrongs being committed on a massive scale - enormous
violations of my personal ethics committed by politicians.  Because the scale
of these wrongs was so large, it seemed natural to me to be very upset about them.
It took me quite some time to realize the futility of spending my emotional energy
in this way.  It just seemed so &hellip; <strong>right</strong> &hellip; to be indignant about all
that wrongness.</p>

<p>But my angry rants, fist-shaking, and even letter-writing to my Congresspeople
made no detectable impact.  Politicians kept on being politicians, and I kept
on being upset, and losing sleep, and feeling grumpy, and sometimes genuinely
depressed - until I realized I didn&rsquo;t have to be upset.</p>

<p>Now, I am certainly not saying that I&rsquo;ve changed my opinion of politics and now
approve of the behavior of politicians.  No, I still think they&rsquo;re by and large
crooked.  What&rsquo;s different is that I now try and view politics as I might view
the tide: It&rsquo;s a part of my environment - a very powerful and potentially
dangerous part - over which I have very little control.  Getting upset can be
reasonably expected to have no impact at all on the problem, and to have a
significant negative impact on my well-being.</p>

<h3 id="out-of-control:40626cd8c68e6d6c813cf7ed8baa1fc8">Out of Control</h3>

<p>Consider this short list of things that are mostly or entirely out of your control:</p>

<ul>
<li>The behavior of other people, including

<ul>
<li>politicians</li>
<li>your kids</li>
<li>your spouse</li>
<li>your boss</li>
<li>other drivers on the road</li>
<li>that person who&rsquo;s <strong>wrong</strong> on Facebook</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The weather</li>
<li>Disease</li>
<li>Death</li>
</ul>

<p>Think about these and other things outside your control.  How much emotional
energy are you investing in them?  How much value are you getting out of that
emotional investment?</p>

<h3 id="within-control:40626cd8c68e6d6c813cf7ed8baa1fc8">Within Control</h3>

<p>What, then is <strong>within</strong> our control?  The Stoics said, and I think they got it
right, that we have control only over our own thoughts and actions.  And since
this is where we have control, this is where our emotional energies are best
invested.</p>

<p>We serve ourselves best when we put our emotional weight not on our
circumstances, which are often outside our control, but instead on our
<em>responses</em> to those circumstances.  Not on past events, which are always out
of our control (being in the past), but instead on <em>learning</em> from what has
happened.  Not on anticipated future events, but instead of <em>preparing</em>
ourselves to face those events in our preferred ways.</p>

<p>When, as is often the case, we find ourselves astray and investing emotional
energy unproductively, the Stoics recommend repeating to ourselves the maxim
with which we began: &ldquo;Some things are under our control, while others are not.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="learn-more:40626cd8c68e6d6c813cf7ed8baa1fc8">Learn More</h3>

<p>Don&rsquo;t take my word about Stoicism.  I&rsquo;m a student, not a master.  To learn more
about Stoicism, I recommend the following resources:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://blogs.exeter.ac.uk/stoicismtoday/">Stoicism Today</a>, home of the annual <a href="http://blogs.exeter.ac.uk/stoicismtoday/files/2015/11/Stoic-Week-2015-Handbook-Stoicism-Today.pdf">Stoic Week</a>, which I strongly recommend.</li>
<li><a href="https://howtobeastoic.wordpress.com/">How to Be a Stoic</a>, a blog by Massimo Pigliucci, who originally introduced
me to Stoic Week.</li>
