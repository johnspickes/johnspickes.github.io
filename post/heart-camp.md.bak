I want to share an experience that my family had for the first time in June
2016, and which I think will become a fixture in our lives for the forseeable
future.  I'm talking about an event called [Family HEART
Camp](http://familyheartcamp.org/).

It is rather difficult to describe this experience briefly.  It's also hard to
describe without sounding ... well ... maybe a bit crazy.  People often
exaggerate and use superlatives inappropriately.  I am not exaggerating in what
I will write here.  It is not an exaggeration to describe our experience with
HEART Camp as profoundly restorative - the most restorative week I can recall
ever having.  It was also deeply transformative, in ways I'll try to explain
here.

### Background

Some years before we first learned of and participated in HEART Camp, we began
studying and practicing [*Nonviolent Communication*](http://cnvc.org), also
called *Compassionate Communication*, especially in our parenting.  NVC is a
large subject which cannot be easily encapsulated in a short article.  All the
same, I think I should give you a bit of the flavor of it, so that those of you
unfamiliar with NVC will have some context in which to place the experiences I
want to describe.

In practicing NVC, we are emphasizing human connection as a core value in our
family.  We strive to treat each other - parents, kids, and others - with love
and respect at all times and in all circumstances.  We seek to understand each
others' inner lives - what we're all feeling, and what deeper causes are
driving those feelings.  We recognize that we all have the same fundamental
needs, and that we're all acting, all the time, to get our needs met.  We work
hard to establish a "power with" relationship - in which we work together to
care for everyone - as opposed to a "power over" relationship in which some
people issue instructions that the others must obey.

Especially if you're not already experienced with NVC, you might have found that
last sentence a bit ... odd.  It might strike you that we're doing something
unusual.  I want to assure you that we *are* doing something unusual, and this
is actually important to know, as it's a big part of our experience around HEART
Camp.

You see, what we're trying to do - the way we're trying to interact with each
other - runs somewhat against the grain of common parenting practice in the US.
It's not my purpose in this article to delve deeply into the differences
between our preferred approach and the mainstream.  Suffice it to say that,
although we felt strong conviction in our parenting choices, we also felt
*profound loneliness* back in June 2016 when we decided to give HEART Camp a
try.

### A Day at Camp

We attended the instance of HEART Camp that takes place at a place called
[Abrams Creek Campground and Retreat](http://www.abramscreek.com/) in West
Virginia.  The facility has a lodge house, a campground, a number of cabins,
and a long stretch of frontage along a wide, rocky, swiftly running creek.
It's wooded, peaceful, and isolated.  We were four of perhaps fifty people who
participated in the weeklong event.  Around half of those in attendance were
kids younger than thirteen years old.

A day at camp is organized rather loosely in the following way.  Following
breakfast, everyone gathers into a circle.  The circle is an important part of
daily life at camp.  During the morning circle, everyone, including camp
organizers and participants, has the opportunity to offer things to the
community.  These offerings include all the pre-arranged camp programming,
classes, and games, and also anything that anyone wants to offer.  For example,
I brought several ukuleles and offered to teach anyone who would like to learn.
The bulk of the day consists of, well, doing whatever you find serves you best.
You may choose to spend time learning about NVC, or painting, or playing
capture the flag, or swimming, or making lunch for everyone, or napping in a
hammock.  In the evening, the circle reconvenes, and everyone is invited to
share their experiences, celebrations, mournings, and anything that they want to
share.

### Kids in the Village

A striking aspect of the HEART Camp experience, as a parent, is the shift in
the experience of "child care".  Let me offer a somewhat nerdy analogy:

In "normal" day-to-day American life with kids, think of the parents as forming
the nucleus of an atom, and the kids as bound electrons zooming around in a
cloud surronding the nucleus.  In HEART Camp life, the arrangement is much more like a
plasma.  The adults still form whatever groups they form, and the kids flow freely
from one place to another, independently of the nuclei.

The effect this has on parents and kids is substantial.  As a parent, I
experienced several feelings in differing amounts as the week progressed.
Early on, I felt a certain discomfort, almost a guilt, around not having my
eyes on my kids at all times.  "Am I unfairly burdening some other person with
the care of my children at this moment?", might have been a fair verbalization
of what I felt.  As time progressed, a deep, not altogether familiar, comfort
set in.  I realized that other people's children were playing around me, that I
was not at all bothered by this, that I was happily interacting with them, and
that everyone else seemed to be having the same experience.  Moreover, I realized
that in this environment I, and everyone else, had freedom that we often don't
feel we have: the freedom to engage or not according to our own needs.

This, I think, was a direct consequence of having a large number of
mutually-supportive families in the same place.  Not only were we
mutually-supportive, but we were all on the same page with respect to how we
wanted to interact with each other, whether adults or kids.  Because there were
many of us, it was easy for kids to find people (often other kids, but not
always) with whom to interact, play, and from whom to get help when it was
occosionally needed.  And, it was feasible for adults to spend time serving
their own needs, which then made them *able* to joyfully serve the needs of
everyone else, adults and kids alike.

It's hard to describe the feeling this brings to a parent, especially a parent
of young children.  I spend much of my life nowadays with a background thread
running, interrupting every few minutes, saying "Are the kids OK?  What are
they up to?  Is there anything I need to protect them from?"  To feel this
process shutting down is a tremendous relief.  To feel that time for yourself,
no matter what you wanted to do with that time, is really and truly OK to take,
and is not in some way selfish or letting someone down - it's very hard to put
into words.

We watched our kids and all the others blossom in this environment.  The
freedom they experienced at camp appeared to somehow bring out all the best
aspects of their personalities.  Behaviors that we find troublesome at home
essentially vanished, and the kids seemed genuinely and deeply happy.  In no
way did they appear to want more from us as parents than we were giving them.
Conflicts were infrequent, and when they arose there were always people at
hand, their hearts full of caring and respect, willing to aid in resolution.
Both of our kids talk often of the good time they had at camp, and they openly
look forward to doing it again.

### Choice Everywhere

The idea of a summer camp might bring to mind thoughts of planned activities,
crafts, and games, with perky camp counselors trying to drum up engagement from
the campers.  I can recall experiencing a lot of discomfort in my childhood as
teachers and other facilitators tried to cajole me into some "fun" activity or
other, of which I prefered not to partake.  An aspect of HEART Camp that stood
out strongly to me is in stark contrast to those experiences:  Everything at
HEART Camp involves choice.

You have a choice about whether you want to show up to the morning circle.  You
have a choice about whether you want to participate in literally *any* activity
on offer.  If you show up for an activity and decide it's not for you, you're
free to go do something else.

Even things that our society would normally describe as "rules" were full of
choice.  We set out community agreements about a variety of things, from
swimming safety to how we would manage to get meals ready and dishes cleaned
up.  We established agreements within families about how we'd behave towards
each other, for example whether and how we would keep each other up to date
on our whereabouts.  The terms of every agreement were negotiable.  Everyone's
needs were considered with care.

Every person's choice was fundamentally respected by every other person.  If
you were invited "Hey, come play capture the flag with us!" and you responded
"No, thanks", that was that.  There was no cajoling.  Everyone assumed that
people were exercising choice to serve their own needs as best they could, and
what's more, everyone *genuinely wanted* everyone else to serve their own
needs.  Nobody would have *wanted* someone to play capture the flag if that
person really wanted to do something else instead.

### Human Connection and Support

This is perhaps the deepest, and most difficult to communicate point.  It's the
point I hear most often raised by participants in this community.

The level of human connection we found at HEART Camp was beyond our normal
experience.

NVC is *about* human connection fundamentally.  It's about listening to each
other, empathizing, understanding what's going on for each of us, and showing
each other that we understand.  It's about a different way of *thinking* about
human behavior.  It's about looking first towards what's going on for each
person, what he or she is feeling and needing, instead of making judgments
about rightness or wrongness - judgments that often impede our ability to
understand one another.  One can read about these concepts, and watch seminars,
and even attempt to apply them as we had been, without understading them
viscerally.

HEART Camp can be thought of as a language immersion program for NVC.

When one is learning a new language, one can spend a lot of time memorizing
grammar and vocabulary, forming sentences, and translating things, and can even
feel rather competent in the new language in the way.  However, a fundamental
change often occurs when one is *immersed* in the language, using it all day
for everything: one begins to *think* in the new language.  This brings about
a much deeper mastery.  No longer is the student constantly translating to and from
the new language; these steps become unnecessary, and thoughts are simply formed
in the new language.

Our experience with HEART Camp was very much like this.  Although we were
speaking English, everyone was making an effort to *think* in terms of human
feelings and needs.  After a few days of this, our experience of each other
began to change.

Not only were we each individually thinking of each other in terms of empathy,
but each of us also found ourselves surrounded by people who were looking on us
with empathy and compassion.  From this, a profound sense of support and
community arose.

This may be hard to understand if you haven't experienced something like it.  I
found the experience unfamiliar myself, which I think must be part of why it
was so striking to me.  Imagine being in a place where every person around you
genuinely feels compassionately toward you - where everyone cares about your
experience, and wants you to have whan you need - where whatever you are
feeling is OK.  Imagine that you can trust that if you need to cry, or laugh,
or rage, or be alone, or be hugged, or be carried, those around you will not
judge you; No, in fact they will literally *thank* you for the experience of
supporting you.  Many of us have not experienced this level of trust and
support in our lives, except perhaps with our closest friends.  I'm telling you
that this ethos *permeated* the environment by the middle of the week.

I witnessed this change happening in others and myself throughout the week we
spent at HEART Camp.  I saw people unwind and spill out their deepest fears,
their deepest shames, and their deepest joys.  I actively participated.  I
watched them cry and laugh in each other's arms.  And yes, I watched people
*literally thank* others for the experience of supporting them.  I can
personally attest to this.  I myself found great joy in supporting my new
friends when they needed it.  It was such an honor.

### Gratitudes

HEART Camp tradition is to conclude the week with the exchanging of gratitudes.
The practice is as follows: Everyone mills about in the main meeting area,
approaching anyone they feel a desire to approach.  Upon approaching, the one
offers the other a short piece of colorful string, and ties it around the
other's wrist, and expresses whatever gratitude comes up, great or small.  This
often results in tears and hugs.

I remember offering a gratitude to one friend whose smile I had watched
re-emerge throughout the week.  I offered another to a friend who had sat with
me and listened as I cried.  In another case, I was overcome by emotion and was
unable to do anything other than finish tying the string on and exchange a long
hug.

Everyone left with wrists full of colored string; tokens of gratitude from our
beloved friends, many of whom had been complete strangers to us only a week
before.  I personally found it very, very difficult to want to remove the
string, even as time passed and the bracelet became progressively more
ratty-looking.  Maybe this year I'll come up with a way to preserve them.

### Returning to the Outside

Upon leaving camp, within hours I had an experience that starkly highlighted
the contrast between the way of being with people that we had experienced at
camp, and the way that people interact in the outside world.

We stopped at Five Guys to meet family, and as the group got settled I took the
job of placing our order.  As the young lady behind the counter asked for my
order, I noticed her quickly blush and sheepishly look away.  I realized after
a moment that I had been looking directly into her eyes, and had asked quite
genuinely how she was doing.  Here I was, a complete stranger, just another
customer among hundreds she usually encountered day by day, and I had expressed
through my words and my body language an honest interest in her inner life.  I
realized how unusual my behavior had been.  Although it's common for us to ask
each other "how are you?", it's not common for us to actually *mean* it.
