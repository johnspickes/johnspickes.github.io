      <article class="post-content">
      <p>Over the weekend I was working in the garage, and I came across an old tool box
that I inherited from my grandfather.</p>

<p>We called him Papa. I remember him often working on some engine or other, for
his boat, or his lawn mower, or his truck. His hands were often a little greasy
as I remember him.</p>

<p>I set about sorting through the contents of this old, rusted tool box. There
were his old Craftsman wrenches, including one he had snapped in half somehow.
His pliers. A couple spark plugs, a light bulb, and a variety of hardware from
whatever his last project was. All of this had a slight coating of grease,
which got on my hands as I worked through the box.</p>

<p>In the bottom of the box were some old pine needles. Papa and Meme (which is
what we called my grandmother) had lived on a lot surrounded by many pines with
long needles. I imagine these must have fallen in and gotten left under the
tools during some project. There were always a lot of pine needles on the
ground there.</p>

<p>It had been some time since I thought about Papa, and going through his tools,
and accepting them as mine, and getting his grease on my hands&hellip; It was
emotional.</p>

<p>Now, my children call me &ldquo;Papa&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I put the useful tools in my big red tool chest, and the hardware in my parts
box. And after a while, I wiped the grease off my hands.</p>

<p>I left the pine needles in the tool box.</p>
