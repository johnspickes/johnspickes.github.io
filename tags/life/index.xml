      <description>Over the weekend I was working in the garage, and I came across an old tool box that I inherited from my grandfather.
We called him Papa. I remember him often working on some engine or other, for his boat, or his lawn mower, or his truck. His hands were often a little greasy as I remember him.
I set about sorting through the contents of this old, rusted tool box.</description>
