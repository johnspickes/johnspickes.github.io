      <description>I want to try a different approach to my online interactions. I&amp;rsquo;ve played with Facebook for a while, and I&amp;rsquo;ve decided, for now anyway, that it&amp;rsquo;s not my thing. Other social media seem to have similar problems. Fighting Conversations on Facebook are too often heated. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s that everything is open - all conversations potentially have an audience. Maybe that drives people to feel that they must &amp;ldquo;win&amp;rdquo; every argument. Often, the conversation participants are &amp;ldquo;friends of friends&amp;rdquo;, writing to people they don&amp;rsquo;t know, making assumptions about them based on little or no information.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m giving Hugo a try. Why? I want my files. I like them to be here, on my machine, editable offline, going with me wherever I go. I like Markdown. I like my files to be in a format I can easily read and edit. I like being able to easily move my content elsewhere when I change my mind. And I will. Markdown is easy to read and convert. I like using my own editor.</description>
