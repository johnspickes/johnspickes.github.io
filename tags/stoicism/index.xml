      <description>This was written as a guest post for the blog Advancing to Greater. Please check it out. Some things are under our control, while others are not. This is one of the core teachings of the ancient philosophy of Stoicism: that we should be always aware of which things are inside our control, and which things are outside. What purpose does it serve to maintain an awareness of the limits of our control?</description>

      <description>What follows is a journal entry I wrote on December 1, 2014. I kind of half-assed my way through Stoic week, and certainly didn&amp;rsquo;t give it the effort it deserved. My excuse is that I was trying to be a good parent, and neglected the Stoic Week practice for that. Anyway, I do feel I came away with some useful nuggets. One of Stoicism&amp;rsquo;s main ideas is to be conscious of what&amp;rsquo;s under your control and what isn&amp;rsquo;t.</description>
