      <description>My unpopular opinion of the day: I&amp;rsquo;m scared of Net Neutrality.
I have no doubt that this seems positively outlandish to many people, so let me explain.
Of course I&amp;rsquo;m for good internet service, and all that. I don&amp;rsquo;t want my ISP direct my traffic to services they&amp;rsquo;d prefer I visit, or restrict what I can do, or any of that. I&amp;rsquo;m totally for freedom on the internet.
So, you may ask, what am I worried about?</description>

      <description>So, yeah&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since I last used this blog - but you don&amp;rsquo;t want to read a blog post about how I haven&amp;rsquo;t been using my blog. I&amp;rsquo;ll cut to the meat, and come back to the blog-related stuff at the end.
I have spent far too many brain cycles thinking about politics. I&amp;rsquo;ve come to realize this over the course of the last few years.</description>
