      <description>I want to try a different approach to my online interactions.
I&amp;rsquo;ve played with Facebook for a while, and I&amp;rsquo;ve decided, for now anyway, that it&amp;rsquo;s not my thing. Other social media seem to have similar problems.
Fighting Conversations on Facebook are too often heated.
Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s that everything is open - all conversations potentially have an audience. Maybe that drives people to feel that they must &amp;ldquo;win&amp;rdquo; every argument.</description>
