      <description>&amp;ldquo;He made me angry.&amp;rdquo; This is a common way of talking in modern western society. We talk as though our emotions are directly caused by external stimuli.
It&amp;rsquo;s simple stimulus and response. In this example, some action &amp;ldquo;he&amp;rdquo; has taken has caused my anger; and in real life it often feels like this is what happens. The cause (his action) occurs very shortly before the effect (my anger), and if he hadn&amp;rsquo;t taken his action, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be angry.</description>

      <description>This was written as a guest post for the blog Advancing to Greater. I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll give it a read. Thanks for the invitation, Rich!
Some things are under our control, while others are not. This is one of the core teachings of the ancient philosophy of Stoicism: that we should be always aware of which things are inside our control, and which things are outside. What purpose does it serve to maintain an awareness of the limits of our control?</description>

      <title>End of Stoic Week 2014</title>

      <description>What follows is a journal entry I wrote on December 1, 2014.
I kind of half-assed my way through Stoic week, and certainly didn&amp;rsquo;t give it the effort it deserved. My excuse is that I was trying to be a good parent, and neglected the Stoic Week practice for that.
Anyway, I do feel I came away with some useful nuggets.
One of Stoicism&amp;rsquo;s main ideas is to be conscious of what&amp;rsquo;s under your control and what isn&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

      <description>So, yeah&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since I last used this blog - but you don&amp;rsquo;t want to read a blog post about how I haven&amp;rsquo;t been using my blog. I&amp;rsquo;ll cut to the meat, and come back to the blog-related stuff at the end.
I have spent far too many brain cycles thinking about politics. I&amp;rsquo;ve come to realize this over the course of the last few years.</description>
