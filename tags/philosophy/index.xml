      <description>So, yeah&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since I last used this blog - but you don&amp;rsquo;t want to read a blog post about how I haven&amp;rsquo;t been using my blog. I&amp;rsquo;ll cut to the meat, and come back to the blog-related stuff at the end. I have spent far too many brain cycles thinking about politics. I&amp;rsquo;ve come to realize this over the course of the last few years. For many years before that, I spent a great amount of mental and emotional energy on political issues.</description>
