      <description>One of the skills that I have been practicing in my study of NVC, mindfulness, and rationality is what is variously called &amp;ldquo;original seeing&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;seeing with fresh eyes&amp;rdquo;. It is the skill of observing a thing simply, as though for the first time, with the intention of seeing the thing as it really is. This involves shutting down one&amp;rsquo;s automatic thought processes, and avoiding the application of judgments that come to us naturally.</description>
