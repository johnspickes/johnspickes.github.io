      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning about something called Nonviolent Communication. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to go into the whole topic of NVC here - I just want to write down some thoughts I&amp;rsquo;ve been rolling over in my mind regarding certain ideas that I encountered when learning about it. This hasn&amp;rsquo;t really been built into a well-formed essay yet, so forgive my inelegance. In particular, I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about the extent to which we apply moral judgement, and the effects that has on our happiness, relationships, and communication, and in particular how this relates to parenting.</description>
