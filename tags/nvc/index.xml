      <description>&amp;ldquo;He made me angry.&amp;rdquo; This is a common way of talking in modern western society. We talk as though our emotions are directly caused by external stimuli. It&amp;rsquo;s simple stimulus and response. In this example, some action &amp;ldquo;he&amp;rdquo; has taken has caused my anger; and in real life it often feels like this is what happens. The cause (his action) occurs very shortly before the effect (my anger), and if he hadn&amp;rsquo;t taken his action, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be angry.</description>

      <title>Moral Judgement as an Impediment to Happiness</title>

      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning about something called Nonviolent Communication. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to go into the whole topic of NVC here - I just want to write down some thoughts I&amp;rsquo;ve been rolling over in my mind regarding certain ideas that I encountered when learning about it. This hasn&amp;rsquo;t really been built into a well-formed essay yet, so forgive my inelegance. In particular, I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about the extent to which we apply moral judgement, and the effects that has on our happiness, relationships, and communication, and in particular how this relates to parenting.</description>
